;; OTHER OPTIONS
; The bot has an internal "cooldown timer" which controls under what conditions
; it believes it is being flooded.  If someone messages a command to regexbot
; within this time after someone else has issued a command, they will be ignored
; and the cooldown timer is extended.  Which means that continually repeated
; attempts to command the bot to replace will just get dropped.
; 
; You can tweak this to your liking, by default it is 5 seconds.  If you set it
; to 0, the cooldown timer will be effectively disabled.
flood_cooldown = 5

; The maximum amount of messages to keep in the internal stack.  More messages
; mean more memory usage.  When a message has it's contents modified by a regex,
; the original version is deleted, and the new version replaces it at the top
; of the stack.  Substitution is done on the newest messages first, and old
; messages are automatically removed from the stack
max_messages = 25

[ignore]
; Ignore list.  Just pop in any "key", and the value is the regular expression
; of the person's hostmask to ignore (case insensitive!)
;
; Be aware this only prevents them from issuing commands.
;
; eg:
;  1 = ^.*test.*\!.+$  -- blocks anyone with "test" in their nickname (case sensitive)
;  2 = ^.+@.*\.example\.com$ -- blocks anyone from the "example.com" domain
;  3 =test            -- blocks anyone with "test" anywhere in their hostmask
;
; This ignore list defaults to being empty
